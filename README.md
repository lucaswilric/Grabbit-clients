Grabbit clients
=========

This is a repository of client code for [http://github.com/lucaswilric/grabbit/](Grabbit), which is a Ruby on Rails application that basically stores tagged links and tagged subscriptions to RSS feeds.

This code used to be stored in the Grabbit repository, but it became obvious that it was not sustainable to keep doing things that way, when the server and the client could (nay, often *should*) be on separate machines.

Eventually (I hope) this will morph into a set of RSS apps, since my aim is to make RSS the standard form of input and output for Grabbit.
